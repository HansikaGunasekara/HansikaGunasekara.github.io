👋 I’m **Hansika Gunasekara**, a Machine Learning Engineer with 9 years of experience across
ML systems, MLOps pipelines, MLFlow, CI/CD optimization, intelligent test selection, and multi-agent AI applications.

I have worked on:

- ML-based Intelligent Test Selection (US Patent holder)
- Regression & ensemble models for accident risk prediction
- Numerical reasoning with LLMs (CONVFINQA)
- Real-time multi-agent clinical decision support systems
- MLOps pipelines with MLFlow, Docker, Airflow, Prometheus

This blog documents my journey into **Agentic AI development**, exploring
the intersection of **ML Engineering, LLMs, tool-use agents, planning architectures, and AgenticOps**.
