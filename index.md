Welcome to **From MLOps to AgenticOps** — a technical blog documenting my journey
transitioning from 9 years of Machine Learning Engineering into the new era of Agentic AI Development.

I write about:

- LLM Agents  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool Use & Function Calling
- Agent Architectures (LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel)
- MLOps → AgenticOps transformation
- Real-world lessons from ML production systems
