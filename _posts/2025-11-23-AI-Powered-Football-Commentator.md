# AI-Powered Football Commentator: How Multi-Agent Systems are Changing Sports Media

## ⚽ A New Era of Football Storytelling
Football has always been fueled by stories - the heartbreaks, comebacks, rivalries, golden generations, and unforgettable finals. Fans don't just want scores; they want context, history and drama.

But producing high-quality football content takes time:
- Researching match history
- Understanding team trajectories
- Analysing championships
- Writing compelling stories
- Making quality commentary

The AI-Powered Football Commentator automates this entire workflow.

With nothing more than a request like:

```
    "Create a football commentary about the 2006 FIFA World Cup final"
```

This project implements a multi‑agent football commentary and research
assistant using **Google ADK**, **Gemini models**, and custom tools. It
retrieves FIFA World Cup results, generates structured summaries, saves
Markdown reports, and produces football commentary audio between two fictional hosts.
